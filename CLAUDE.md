# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude when working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

Personal development and life management system for Gabriel Fiedler. Covers health, personal growth, competence development, and goal tracking. Mirrors the structure and philosophy of the Manager repository but focused entirely on personal life.

## Philosophy

1. **Honest over nice.** Self-reflection that avoids the real issues is useless. Name what's actually happening.

2. **Few things, done well.** Maximum 2-3 active focus areas at a time. Everything else is maintenance or waiting.

3. **Systems over willpower.** Build habits and structures that make the right choice the easy choice.

4. **Progress over perfection.** Track direction, not just outcomes. A bad week isn't failure if you learn from it.

5. **Regular review.** Weekly reflection keeps you honest. Quarterly review adjusts the course.

## Key Documents

### Utvecklingsplan.md
Central document for personal growth. Should include:
- Current focus areas (max 2-3)
- Why these matter right now
- Concrete behaviors to practice
- How to know if it's working

### Årsmål (2025.md)
Annual goals across life areas. Each goal should have:
- Clear success criteria
- Why it matters
- Key milestones
- What could derail it

### Veckoreview
Weekly reflection connecting all areas:
- What happened with training/nutrition/recovery?
- Progress on development areas?
- What worked, what didn't?
- Adjustments for next week?

## Working with This Repository

### Weekly Reviews
- Use struktur.md as template
- Be specific about what actually happened, not what you planned
- Connect observations to goals and development areas
- Note patterns over time

### Quarterly Reviews
- Review progress against annual goals
- Adjust goals if circumstances changed
- Identify what's working vs. what's just on paper
- Set focus for next quarter

### Health Tracking
- Träning.md contains principles and current program
- Kost.md contains guidelines, not rigid rules
- Återhämtning.md tracks sleep and stress patterns
- Weekly review captures what actually happened

## Language

Content is in Swedish. This file is in English for consistency with Manager repository.

## Connection to Work

Some competence development (Utveckling/Kompetenser/) benefits both personal and professional life. Examples:
- Presentation skills
- Strategic thinking
- Communication

Cross-reference with Manager/PersonalDevelopment/ where relevant, but keep this repository focused on the personal perspective and motivation.
